<h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>
<p>
    This is a really simple dish to prepare, and itâ€™s always a big hit at
    parties. My father recommends:<br>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just
        bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
        serving it warm."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
    <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
    <li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

        as possible.<br><br></li>
    <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
        incorporated, but still retain some texture.<br><br></li>

        (optional).
    </li>
</ul>
